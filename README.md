# Visual Relation Detection in Images


This is the code of my master thesis **Visual Relation Detection in Images**. The project is based on PyTorch version of [MSDN](https://github.com/yikang-li/MSDN) and [faster R-CNN](https://github.com/longcw/faster_rcnn_pytorch).

I am still working on the project.
